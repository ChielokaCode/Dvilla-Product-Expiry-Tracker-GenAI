It can be used widely in Supermarkets, drug stores and malls to enable users get real time assessment of their products details. The issue of products expiring on shelves is becoming alarming therefore the need to acquire this application.

A key feature is the expiration products page, which lists products nearing expiration within two months or more, helping customers track items close to expiry. This page uses Kendo React grid components with pagination and filtering options. Users can print and export product lists as PDFs, selecting specific columns via checkboxes.
